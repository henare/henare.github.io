<h2>Me</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Henare Degan. I'm a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/civic_hacker">civic and democracy hacker</a> at the <a href="http://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/">OpenAustralia Foundation</a>.</p>
<h2>This blog</h2>
<p>This is a personal, technology focused, blog. You'll mainly find how-to articles (for things I haven't been able to [easily] find elsewhere) or other original technology articles related to my work and OpenAustralia Foundation projects.</p>
<p>Check out my <a href="https://twitter.com/henaredegan/">Twitter feed</a> if you're <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">stalking me</span> more interested in my personal posts as it contains a mix of personal and other posts.</p>
