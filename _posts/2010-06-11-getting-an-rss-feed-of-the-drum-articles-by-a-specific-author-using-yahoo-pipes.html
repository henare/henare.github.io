<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/thedrum/">ABC's The Drum</a> is the ABC's analysis and opinion site. It has a <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/contributors/">diverse range of contributors</a> and I've found <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/lists/opinion-top/rss.xml">the RSS feed</a> a little too active for my liking.</p>
<p>That said, I love the latest presenter of <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/">Media Watch</a>, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/profiles/content/s2761689.htm?site=thedrum">Jonathan Holmes</a>, and I wanted to read just his articles posted on The Drum. <a href="https://twitter.com/henaredegan/status/12204838276">I asked</a> if it was possible to get an RSS feed for specific authors but <a href="https://twitter.com/abcthedrum/status/12254890502">I didn't get far</a> so I decided to fire up the ever-useful <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Pipes</a> to do the job:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=5b1c96bb38b8c70bfbeed17b48771801"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-278" title="abcthedrum_pipe" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/abcthedrum_pipe.png" alt="" width="641" height="343" /></a></p>
<p>You can <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=5b1c96bb38b8c70bfbeed17b48771801">filter by any Author's name from The Drum</a> (just copy and paste the name from the by-line) and then select <em>Run Pipe</em> then <em>Get as RSS</em> to add it to your feed reader of choice. If you find this useful or have other suggestions for how this could be used, please don't hesitate to leave a comment below.</p>
