<p>Running Jira on FreeBSD, I wanted to be able to pick up email from a Google Apps account and feed it in as tickets. This is normally a straight-forward process but I was getting these errors in the Jira logs:</p>
<p><code><br />
javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target<br />
</code></p>
<p>So it seemed like the Gmail SSL certificate for IMAP or POP wasn't validating. That's weird as it would be a major problem if it didn't and they're certainly not using a self-signed certificate.</p>
<p>I checked the keystore and it appeared empty so it looks like FreeBSD's Java doesn't ship with the normal list of CAs. To fix this I did:</p>
<p><code lang="bash"><br />
[henare@freebsd ~]$ ls -l /usr.local/diablo-jdk1.6.0/jre/lib/security/cacerts<br />
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  942    Aug  6  2007 /usr/ports/java/jdk16/files/cacerts<br />
[henare@freebsd ~]$ #wow, that file's really small (this directory was in our JAVA_HOME - don't ask me about the usr.local thing)<br />
[henare@freebsd ~]$ #first, backup this file<br />
[henare@freebsd ~]$ sudo cp /usr/local/diablo-jdk1.6.0/jre/lib/security/cacerts{,_backup`date +%Y%m%d`}<br />
[henare@freebsd ~]$ #now, copy over the file from ports<br />
[henare@freebsd ~]$ sudo cp /usr/ports/java/jdk16/files/cacerts /usr.local/diablo-jdk1.6.0/jre/lib/security/cacerts<br />
[henare@freebsd ~]$ ls -l /usr.local/diablo-jdk1.6.0/jre/lib/security/cacerts<br />
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  40624 Aug  6  2007 /usr/ports/java/jdk16/files/cacerts<br />
[henare@freebsd ~]$ #that looks better<br />
</code></p>
