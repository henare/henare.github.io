<p>In less than a week <strong>I'm off to <a href="http://drupaldownunder.org/">DrupalDownunder</a> for work</strong> as the company I work for has started to look at using more Drupal in the work they do for clients.</p>
<p>Given that I've not delved too deep into <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> and certainly never developed on it, <strong>I thought I had better find out a bit about it</strong> before the conference.</p>
<p>I decided to write a module similar to <a href="http://github.com/henare/oa4wp">oa4wp</a> that <strong>displays your MP's most recent speeches</strong> in a block. After a few hours hacking on Sunday afternoon, here it is:</p>
<p><figure><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/openaustralia-drupal.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-380" title="openaustralia-drupal" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/openaustralia-drupal.png" alt="" width="588" height="458" /></a><figcaption>OpenAustralia Drupal in a content block</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>I was pleased to get something usable in such a short amount of time and found the development reasonably straight-forward, despite the documentation for developers not really being there yet for version 7.</p>
<p>The block also works quite well as a sidebar, depending on what you want to use it for.</p>
<p><strong>Install it</strong>, just like any other module, by <a href="https://github.com/henare/openaustralia-drupal">downloading it</a> and putting it in its own directory in the <tt>sites/all/modules</tt> folder of your Drupal site.</p>
