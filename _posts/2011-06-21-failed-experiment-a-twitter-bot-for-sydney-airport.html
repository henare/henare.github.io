  content: Wow, if we could have a schedule of flight path nasties overlayed with
    our TV guide and anticipate when we would miss that crucial dialogue ... now that
    would be something!

<p>Yesterday I noticed <a href="http://infovore.org/archives/2011/06/12/wheres-towerbridge/">the kerfuffle</a> about the <a href="http://infovore.org/archives/2008/02/28/making-bridges-talk/">UK's Tower Bridge Twitter account</a>. It's a bot that tweets when the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Tower_Bridge">Tower Bridge in London</a> opens and closes.</p>
<p>In the author's announcement of the bot he said,</p>
<blockquote><p>The idea of overhearing machines talking about what they&rsquo;re doing is, to my mind, quite delightful.</p></blockquote>
<p>and I tend to agree.</p>
<p>So I thought I'd look at setting something up locally. I live close to the flight path so while I was pondering this a plane flew over and I thought I'd set up a bot for the Sydney Airport.</p>
<p>They have listings of arrivals and departures so <a href="https://github.com/henare/SYDap">I hacked together a bot</a> and this was the result:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/sydap.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-411" title="SYDap" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/sydap.png" alt="" width="553" height="561" /></a></p>
<p><strong>So why is this a failed experiment?</strong> Well after running it for a time I realised that the source data, scraped from the arrivals and departures page of the Sydney Airport site, didn't really match what I was trying to do with it.</p>
<p>The data is focused on providing information to passengers, not an accurate picture of what really is coming and going from the airport.</p>
<p><strong>The lesson?</strong> Data can't always be hacked to suit other purposes and if it's the foundation of a project, as it so often is, then spend the time ensuring it matches up with what you're trying to do.</p>
<p>That said, I don't consider this a waste of time. Failure's part of the process.</p>
