<p><a href="http://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a>, the people that originally built <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/">TheyWorkForYou</a>, which <a href="http://www.openaustralia.org/">OpenAustralia</a> was built from, are running a <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/2009/08/06/mysociety-call-for-proposals-2009/">call for proposals</a> for ideas for new projects or features for mySociety to work on. These are my favourite ideas so far, in no particular order:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.mysociety.org/2009/08/10/the-peoples-thinktank/">The People's Think Tank</a></strong> - I find this idea interesting considering this week's stoush between the government and opposition on their different climate crisis policy proposals. The treatment from both parties of each other's policies has been pretty brutal and it struck me as very non-constructive. With this idea, you could potentially mash up the proposals and crowd-source the development of the policy.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.mysociety.org/2009/08/10/me-mp/">Me MP</a></strong> - I like this idea for the same reason as a lot of local government 2.0 ideas - that you generally want to do the same basic things and reinventing the wheel is wasteful. This idea applies that principle to running for office and has the potential to disrupt the two-party system.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.mysociety.org/2009/08/10/where-does-it-go/">Where Does It Go</a></strong> - I don't have a comprehensive idea of where public money goes, do you? I see this proposal as applying to the budget, what OpenAustralia applies to the Hansard.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.mysociety.org/2009/08/10/aretheyontime/">AreTheyOnTime</a></strong> - Crowd-sourcing public transport running times, there's not much to say on this one - Sydney-siders would love it! If it was able to kick off, this could be really interesting in a real-time information kind of way - i.e. you could find out pretty accurately how late the service you were waiting for was going to be (could also be applied to buses). That is until we finally get GPS tracking, <a href="http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/Transport/buses/realtime.asp">a al Auckland</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.mysociety.org/2009/08/10/hear-hear/">Hear Hear</a></strong> - This sounds like a quick, simple system for the government to get feedback on ideas. It could become a focal point for the 'good' and 'bad' ideas of the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Now, what say you?</strong></p>
