<p>Despite using <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a> for ages, I've never bothered to work out how to type special characters, like &trade; or &copy;. I've normally just opened the Character Map application and copied from there - obviously this is a bit of a round about process.</p>
<p>I finally decided to look it up and it's as simple as: <strong>Ctrl-Shift and the character code</strong> from Gnome's Character Map application.</p>
<p>So to type &trade;, go to <em>Applications</em> > <em>Accessories</em> > <em>Character Map</em>. Then note the character code:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/character_map.png" alt="" title="character_map" width="498" height="437" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-371" /></p>
<p>Hold down <strong>Ctrl</strong> + <strong>Shift</strong> and type <em>u2122</em>. Simple.</p>
