<p><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/planningalerts.png" alt="" title="PlanningAlerts.org.au" width="262" height="51" class="alignright size-full wp-image-172" />In preparation for the recent <a href="http://hackfest.openaustralia.org/apps4nsw">OpenAustralia Hackfest - apps4nsw Edition</a>, Matthew asked me to add the <a href="http://github.com/openaustralia/planningalerts-app/tree/rails_port">Ruby on Rails port</a> of <a href="http://www.planningalerts.org.au/">PlanningAlerts</a> to <a href="http://www.henaredegan.com/blog/openaustralia-devlive/">DevLive</a> so that developers could poke around with what was an experimental codebase (it's <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/openaustralia-dev/msg/fc2329e424adead1">now deployed</a> - woohoo!).</p>
<p>Unfortunately I wasn't able to attend the hackfest as I was busy jumping out of a plane that weekend but I nonetheless managed to get a new release of DevLive ready that includes a development copy of PlanningAlerts.</p>
<p>I've added the relevant <a href="http://www.henaredegan.com/blog/openaustralia-devlive/">details to the DevLive page</a>, where you can also find <a href="http://oa.communitybuilders.com.au/">download links for v0.1.0 of the appliance</a>.</p>
<p>If you're <em>planning</em> to take a look, I think I should <em>alert</em> you (haw haw!) to the fact that the code is moving at a rapid pace and it might be a good idea to pull an <a href="http://github.com/openaustralia/planningalerts-app/">updated copy of the code from Github</a> to make sure you're seeing the latest-and-greatest code.</p>
<p>If you have any problems with this release or any feature requests, leave them as a <a href="http://www.henaredegan.com/blog/openaustralia-devlive/">comment over on the DevLive page</a>.</p>
