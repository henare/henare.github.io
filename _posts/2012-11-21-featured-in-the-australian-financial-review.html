<p>I haven't posted anything in ages and since this is fast becoming a brag book and not a blog I thought I'd post about how the OpenAustralia crew and I were recently featured in the AFR:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://afr.com/p/technology/our_democracy_opening_crack_by_hack_5767WFvxNBsICg5vl33FLJ">Our democracy opening crack by hack</a></p></blockquote>
<p>There's also <a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Our-democracy-opening-crack-by-hack-2012-10-16-09-33-42.png">a screenshot of the article</a> if that link goes down.</p>
