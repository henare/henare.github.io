<p>If you're like me and <a href="http://xkcd.com/243/">love your nipple</a>, you might prefer to disable the touchpad on your ThinkPad.</p>
<p>In openSUSE this is a trivial affair of opening up the Gnome mouse preferences and unchecking the <em>Enable Touchpad</em> option. When I went searching for this option in Ubuntu 10.04 I couldn't find it, so I searched the Ubuntu Software Centre for "touchpad" and installed GSynaptics, which looked very similar to openSUSE's tool.</p>
<p>GSynaptics disabled the touchpad just fine - until the machine transitioned power state, such as suspend/resume or a reboot. I've found that the reliable way of disabling the touchpad in Gnome is to fire up <em>gconf-editor</em> and locate a setting similar to the following and disable it:</p>
