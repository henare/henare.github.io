<p>As a proof of concept, yesterday I moved our Confluence installation to Solaris under VMWare from it's current home on a Linux box. I won't go into the background as to why I was doing this (most people would be shocked hearing I would move anything <i>from</i> Linux!) but the reason it was a proof of concept was the fact that <a href="http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-11301">Confluence isn't officially supported under VMWare</a>.</p>
<p>A few points:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are lots of Solaris things I don't like after coming from Linux. Packaging first, and the tools it ships with (I want <i>GNU</i> grep and tar, dammit!)</li>
<li>To allow an unprivileged user (our confluence user in this case) to bind to privileged ports (i.e. TCP &lt; 1024), run this as root with the user logged out <code inline="true">usermod -K defaultpriv=basic,net_privaddr confluence</code></li>
<li>Use <code inline="true">prstat</code>, not <code inline="true">top</code> on Solaris</li>
<li>When Atlassian says don't use Solaris' version of <code inline="true">tar</code>, they mean it. I spent about half an hour debugging only to find that Solaris had untarred the file incorrectly. Grrr.</li>
<li>I love open formats and the *nix way. I did a <code inline="true">mysqldump</code> from our old server and found that our DB tables were using the MyISAM engine (not recommended by Atlassian), so I switched to InnoDB by a simple, quick <code inline="true">sed</code> through the dump. Brilliant. I love it.</li>
<li>To stress test the application after the move <a href="http://www.joedog.org/index/siege-home">I used siege</a>, which worked a treat. It's probably packaged for your Linux distro too</li>
</ul>
<p>Confluence seems to be running fine on the new VM and withstood my siege, it's only small (50 MB) so that might be a factor but it's worth testing if you need to make this move yourself.</p>
