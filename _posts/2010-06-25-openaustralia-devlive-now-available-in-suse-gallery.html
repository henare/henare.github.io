<p>The good people of <a href="http://blog.susestudio.com/2010/06/share-your-appliances-with-suse-gallery.html">SUSE Studio have just released SUSE Gallery</a>, which allows you to share appliances built in SUSE Studio (done with the usual SUSE Studio style I might add - "Enabling Infinite Improbability Drive" is displayed when you enable the new features :) nice!).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.henaredegan.com/blog/openaustralia-devlive/">OpenAustralia DevLive</a>, the ready-to-run OpenAustralia.org and PlanningAlerts development environment, is built with SUSE Studio and you can now find it <a href="http://susestudio.com/a/nHUhBK/openaustralia-devlive">published in SUSE Gallery</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.henaredegan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/oa-devlive-suse-gallery.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-298" title="oa-devlive-suse-gallery" src="http://www.henaredegan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/oa-devlive-suse-gallery.png" alt="" width="562" height="439" /></a></p>
<p>This means you can download it directly from SUSE Gallery and more importantly, clone it to customise it or to improve it. I haven't been giving it much love lately ;( so it'd be great if someone added a few new things to it. There's a bunch of things that could be done to improve it and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/openaustralia-dev/msg/49493ddab8d4cfe9">some bugs to fix</a>, which should probably be added to the <a href="http://tickets.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/">ticket tracker</a>.</p>
