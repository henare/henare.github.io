  content: It occured to me that if the Firefox package was updated on a deployed
    appliance, newly created users would get the default openSUSE start page. I guess
    the lesson here is that the 'correct' way would be to create a custom package
    and build that into the appliance.

<p>For OpenAustralia DevLive, I wanted the browser to open straight into the local machine's development instance of the web application. I also wanted to provide a bunch of project related links as bookmarks to make it easy for users to get help or submit bugs.</p>
<p>To change the browser start page you need to add an overlay file called <em>browserconfig.properties</em> in the <em>/usr/lib/firefox</em> directory (<em>/usr/lib64/firefox</em> with 64 bit Firefox), with the following contents:</p>
<pre>browser.startup.homepage=http://dev.openaustralia.org/
browser.startup.homepage_reset=http://dev.openaustralia.org/</pre>
<p>To customise the default bookmarks, export a <em>bookmarks.html</em> file from Firefox and upload it as an overlay in the <em>/usr/lib/firefox/defaults/profile</em> directory.</p>
<p>Both these files normally have the permissions <em>root:root 644</em>.</p>
