  content: Good tip, thanks Henare. I found it a bit tricky that there were not more
    open id services on the list. It was a good prompt for me to get an open id account
    though. Instead of using http://openid.net/ (seemingly $25 for an individual to
    set up an account ) I was reffered to https://www.myopenid.com/ ($nada).

    Thanks for the first comment ever Eri! :)

    Yeah, unfortunately not many people understand OpenID so those little icons people put on sites still need to be there. We really need to publicise OpenID more.

    Getting an OpenID login from another site defeats the purpose of OpenID (to only have one password to remember) so that's why I want to use my Google Account.

<p>It was harder than it should have been to find the URL to use for the OpenID provided by your Google Account, so for future reference, enter this in the address box of OpenID enabled sites:</p>
<p><code>https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id</code></p>
